# UX-Focused Projects

## Overview

This repository contains three major Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) projects, each focusing on the development of user-friendly systems through a deep understanding of user needs and behaviors. These projects showcase the application of user experience (UX) research and methodologies, including user testing, heuristic evaluations, and persona development, to create intuitive and engaging interactive systems.

## SitDown App

### Focus: User Research and Contextual Inquiry

The **SitDown App** is designed to help students and remote workers find ideal cafes to work or study. The development process involved extensive **context of use analysis** through interviews, contextual inquiries, and ethnographic observation. User personas like Jason (a student) and Britney (a remote worker) were developed to guide design decisions. Task analysis and user journey maps were used to streamline the app’s functionality, ensuring it meets the users' key needs, such as Wi-Fi access, quiet environments, and seating availability. Usability testing further refined the app's UX to create a seamless experience for users.

## Ryanair Heuristic Evaluation

### Focus: Heuristic Analysis and UX Improvements

The **Ryanair Heuristic Evaluation** project involved analyzing Ryanair's website using Jakob Nielsen’s usability heuristics. The goal was to assess the website’s effectiveness in providing a smooth booking process. Key heuristics like **visibility of system status**, **match between system and the real world**, and **error prevention** were evaluated. This project emphasized improving the UX by identifying usability problems, proposing solutions to enhance user control, and streamlining the user’s journey from flight selection to payment confirmation. 

## Social Activity App

### Focus: Persona Creation and Interaction Design

The **Social Activity App** was developed as part of the HCI course, focusing on connecting users based on shared hobbies and organizing group activities. The project involved extensive **user interviews** and **persona development** to represent young students new to foreign countries. Task flows, wireframes, and user flows were designed to guide users through key tasks such as creating and editing events, joining activities, and vetting participant requests. The project's focus on **persona analysis** helped ensure the app was intuitive and responsive to the needs of its target audience.
